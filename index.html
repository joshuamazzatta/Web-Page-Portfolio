    <h2>About Joshua</h2>
      <article> <!--a few paragraphs about me-->
        <p>I am from sunny San Diego, California! I enlisted into the Navy out of California as an Engineman and from there I started my journey as a Mechanical Engineer. Once I was out of the military, I moved back to California and decided to pursue a future in Software Engineering! Outside of Software Development/Engineering I love to dabble in Graphic Design as well as various forms of writing!</p>

        <p>In January of 2020, I took my first programming class through University of Michigan and achieved my basics certificate for Python-3! Ever since then, I've been on a journey to further my knowledge in this career field. I'm currently a full-time student at Thinkful taking UI/UX Design Immersion. I couldn't be more excited for what the future holds for me.</p>

        <p>If you or anyone you know of is interested in hiring a new Software Developer, please feel free to reach out!</p>
